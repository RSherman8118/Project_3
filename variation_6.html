<h2>YOU CAN ONLY WORK FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU LIKE</h2>

<H1 class="cyan">WORK</H1>



<p>This is a curious rule and it took me a long time to learn because in fact at the beginning
of my practice I felt the opposite.Professionalism required that you didnâ€™t particularly
like the people that you worked for or at least maintained an arms length relationship
to them, which meant that I never had lunch with a client or saw them socially. Then some years ago I realized that the opposite was true. I discovered that all the work I
had done that was meaningful and significant came out of an affectionate relationship
with a client. And I am not talking about professionalism; I am talking about affection.
I am talking about a client and you sharing some common ground. That in fact your
view of life is someway congruent with the client, otherwise it is a bitter and hopeless
struggle.</p>
