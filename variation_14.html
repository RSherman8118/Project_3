<h5 class="shift">you can only work for people that you like</h5>




<p>This is a curious rule and it took me a long time to learn because in fact at the beginning
of my practice I felt the opposite.</p>






<p class="Happytimes">Professionalism required that you didnâ€™t particularly
like the people that you worked for or at least maintained an arms length relationship
to them, which meant that I never had lunch with a client or saw them socially. 


Then some years ago I realized that the opposite was true.</p>



<p class="rotate">

And I am not talking about professionalism; I am talking about affection.
I am talking about a client and you sharing some common ground. That in fact your
view of life is someway congruent with the client, otherwise it is a bitter and hopeless
struggle.</p>





<p class="Happytimes">I discovered that all the work I
had done that was meaningful and significant came out of an affectionate relationship
with a client.</p>
