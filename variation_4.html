<p class="lack2">Professionalism required that you didnâ€™t particularly
like the people that you worked for or at least maintained an arms length relationship
to them, which meant that I never had lunch with a client or saw them socially.

I am talking about a client and you sharing some common ground. That in fact your
view of life is someway congruent with the client, otherwise it is a bitter and hopeless
struggle.</p>

had done that was meaningful and significant came out of an affectionate relationship
with a client.</p>
